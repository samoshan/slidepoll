# SlidePolls

## Intro
SlidePolls is an open-source tool that allows polls to be created and embedded directly into Microsoft PowerPoint presentations via an add-in, or viewed on the web.
The target use case is for education, to provide a way for teachers to add interactivity to their presentations to make them more engaging for students.

## Types of Polls
There are currently 4 types of polls implemented:
* Multiple Choice
* Ranked Choice
* Open Ended Response
* Reactions (respondents pick a mood/emoji representing their reaction to the prompt)

## Tech Stack
Back End:
* TypeScript
* Node
* NestJS
* MongoDB
* Redis

Front End:
* JavaScript
* React
* HTML/CSS

## Future Improvements
I am currently in the process of changing the underlying database technology to a relational database, and after doing so will publish the service on the web so that it can be used without self-hosting
